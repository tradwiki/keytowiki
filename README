==Description==

Python script using the pywikibot framework that streamlines audio uploading to http://leviolondejos.wiki/ via the following
functionnalities:

  1. Recording midi input from a virtual midi port (user must install 3rd party software to connect midi instrument to this port,
  see below)
  2. Automatically creating score image (.png) and midi file using music21 library
  3. Automatically uploading above files to the wiki along with semantic annotations
  4. Open form in browser to create page with additional information about the recording

==Dependencies==

The software requires the following packages to be installed on your system:
  
  *python 3.4 or above with the following libraries:
    **music21
    **mido
    **python-rtmidi
    
  *lilypond
  
  *pywikibot (tested on current nightly release with commit number 4bb76aa37d99, latest stable verions(2.0rc3 ) does not work
  because of upload.py script not having the '-always' option yet. Once this option is included in stable release, you should
  use that one.)

==Intallation and usage==

  Requirements: 
    The script has been tested in Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 7. As far as I know, the required dependencies are 
    available in Mac OS and none of the functions used in the script itself are platform dependent, so it should be possible 
    to run in Mac as well. 
  
  Once the above dependencies are installed, paste the files in this git into the pywikibot installation folder (merge folders
  where required).You can then run the script from the command line by going into your pywikibot installation folder, logging 
  in the bot with the following command (note: this relies on configuration files in the installation folder that are included 
  in this github, but that need to be adapted for each bot user account and wiki, see pywikibot documentation on installing for
  third party wikis): 
  
    "python3 pwb.py login" 
  
  and then invoking the music_bot.py script with the following command:
  
    "python3 pwb.py music_bot"

    Newby programmer at work. Feel free to tell me where my certainly numerous errors are to be found.
    I also don't know anything about licenses, but feel free to do anything you want with my code, located in
